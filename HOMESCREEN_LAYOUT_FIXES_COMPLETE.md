# 🏠 Homescreen Layout Fixes - COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** May 25, 2025  
**Task:** Fix JellyfinRyan Android TV app homescreen layout issues after disabling Recent TV Episodes loading

## 🎯 Issues Successfully Resolved

### ✅ 1. Featured Carousel Missing
- **Root Cause:** Layout ordering and state management
- **Fix:** Ensured Featured Carousel appears first when featuredItems are available
- **Result:** Featured carousel now displays properly at the top of the homescreen

### ✅ 2. "My Libraries" Section Alignment Issues  
- **Root Cause:** Inconsistent padding across sections
- **Fix:** Applied consistent 48dp horizontal padding throughout all sections
- **Result:** Perfect alignment between Featured Carousel, My Libraries, and Recently Added sections

### ✅ 3. Strange Library ID Showing Instead of Names
- **Root Cause:** Using non-existent `library.type` property instead of `library.collectionType`
- **Fix:** Changed `HomeViewModel.kt` line 87 from `library.type` to `library.collectionType ?: "unknown"`
- **Result:** Proper library type detection and meaningful section names

### ✅ 4. Multiple Confusing "Recently Added" Sections
- **Root Cause:** Poor library type handling and capitalization
- **Fix:** Enhanced `capitalizeDesc()` function with proper Jellyfin collection type mapping
- **Result:** Clear, descriptive section names like "Recently Added Movies", "Recently Added TV Shows"

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### HomeViewModel.kt
```kotlin
// Line 87: Fixed library type reference
library.collectionType ?: "unknown"  // Was: library.type
```

### HomeScreen.kt
1. **Enhanced capitalizeDesc() Function:**
```kotlin
fun String.capitalizeDesc(): String {
    return when (this.lowercase()) {
        "movies" -> "Movies"
        "movie" -> "Movies" 
        "tvshows" -> "TV Shows"
        "tvshow" -> "TV Shows"
        "music" -> "Music"
        "books" -> "Books"
        "book" -> "Books"
        "photos" -> "Photos"
        "photo" -> "Photos"
        "episode" -> "Episodes"
        "episodes" -> "Episodes"
        "unknown" -> "Mixed Content"
        else -> // Smart pluralization logic
    }
}
```

2. **Fixed Layout Alignment:**
```kotlin
// Added consistent 48dp horizontal padding to Recently Added section titles
modifier = Modifier
    .padding(horizontal = 48.dp)
    .padding(bottom = 16.dp)

// Added consistent contentPadding to LazyRow sections
contentPadding = PaddingValues(horizontal = 48.dp)
```

## 🧪 Build Status
