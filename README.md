2. **Find line ~46:** Look for the TV Episodes section
3. **Replace this line:**
   ```kotlin
   val recentEpisodes = emptyList<JellyfinItem>() // Remove this line and uncomment above to activate
   ```
4. **With this line:**
   ```kotlin
   val recentEpisodes by viewModel.recentTvEpisodes.collectAsState()
   ```
5. **Build the project:** Run `./gradlew assembleDebug`

The TV Episodes section will then display the last 10 episodes added across all your TV libraries.
